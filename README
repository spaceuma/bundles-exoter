#ExoTeR bundle
ExoTeR specific bundle that builds on top of [our generic rover bundle](https://github.com/esa-prl/bundles-rover).
Bundles are packages that offer a "system-wide" view of software functionality
in Rock.
They contain the configs and scripts necessary to configure, connect, and run multiple modules.
